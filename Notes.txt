from the folder type in the terminal
npm start   
right now it is set up for port 3000 which is being used
so it changes to port 3001 and displays a web page.

I already added Victor to it.

The App.css file does the rotation. this makes it spin faster. was 50s now 1s
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  .App-logo {
    animation: App-logo-spin infinite 1s linear;
  }
}

Also at save of the CSS file the page is updated 
The App.js file where my name is requires a page refresh.
